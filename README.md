# Gaming QoE Conference - Paper Reproduction

This repository contains the code and data needed to reproduce the experiments from our Gaming Quality of Experience research paper.

## 🔬 Experiment Overview

### Data Collection Process

*Video: Creating controlled network impairments for QoE data collection*

This video demonstrates our experimental setup for collecting labeled QoE data. We systematically introduced network impairments to create different gaming experience conditions, allowing us to collect ground-truth data across various QoE levels.

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](artifacts/figures/Arch.png)

*System Architecture: Online and offline processing modes for QoE classification*

Our system operates in two modes:

- **Offline Mode**: Used for training and experimentation with collected data
- **Online Mode**: Real-time gameplay QoE classification during active gaming sessions

**Key Components:**
- **Passive Traffic Capture**: Monitors encrypted network traffic without affecting gameplay
- **Game Session Detection**: Identifies relevant gaming traffic (UDP, 7000-10000 port range, ≥20 PPS)
- **Feature Extraction**: Processes raw packets into 30 network traffic features
- **QoE Classification**: Applies trained models for real-time QoE assessment

The system can be deployed at various network levels, from local routers to ISP infrastructure, making it suitable for both research and practical deployment scenarios.

### Key Results Preview

## 📋 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ 
- pip or conda

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArielCyber/gaming-qoe-conference.git
cd gaming-qoe-conference
```

2. **Request Dataset Access**: Contact the authors via email to obtain the preprocessed datasets required for reproduction. The datasets include:
   - `window_3_*.csv` (3-second windows)
   - `window_5_*.csv` (5-second windows) 
   - `window_10_*.csv` (10-second windows)
   - `window_15_*.csv` (15-second windows)

   Place these files in an `output/` directory in the repository root.

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Experiments

**Option 1: Full Paper Reproduction**
```bash
jupyter lab paper_repro.ipynb
```
Run all cells to reproduce the complete paper experiments.

**Option 2: Quick Validation**
```bash
python test_minimal_repro.py
```
Runs a minimal test to verify the setup is working.

**Option 3: Environment Validation**
```bash
python paper_repro_utils.py
```
Validates that all dependencies and datasets are available.

## 📁 Generated Artifacts

After running paper_repro.ipynb, the following files will be created:

### Tables
- artifacts/tables/results_3class_metrics.csv - Complete metrics for all models
- artifacts/tables/window_sensitivity_results.csv - Window size analysis results

### Figures  
- artifacts/figures/confusion_matrix_*.png - Confusion matrices for each model
- artifacts/figures/window_size_metrics.png - Window sensitivity plot

### Reproducibility
- artifacts/run_versions.txt - Environment and library versions
- artifacts/run_versions.json - Machine-readable version info

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Splitting Strategy
We use **experiment-based splitting** where every 4th experiment is reserved for testing. This ensures:
- No data leakage between training and testing sets
- Test data comes from completely unseen gaming sessions  
- More realistic and conservative performance estimates
- Results that reflect true generalization capability

### Feature Engineering
- **30 network traffic features** extracted from gaming sessions
- Features include packet sizes, packet rates, and directional ratios
- Data from multiple window sizes (3s, 5s, 10s, 15s)

### QoE Classification
- **3-class QoE prediction** based on ping latency thresholds
- Classes: Good (Class 1), Fair (Class 2), Poor (Class 3)
- Evaluation using accuracy, macro F1, and weighted F1 scores
